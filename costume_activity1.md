# Choose the costumes

## Step 1
Look at the lock to see what numbers it's displaying and then use the closet to find which costume pieces match that number. Once you've matched them up, use the ``||hoc:head, body, and legs||`` block to open the lock.

#### ~ tutorialhint
Make sure to set the numbers inside the closet to match the numbers on the lock, and then code that costume set.
