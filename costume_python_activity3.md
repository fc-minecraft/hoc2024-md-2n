# Choose the costumes

```python-template
hoc.costume(HeadWear.Knight_Helmet, MidWear.Cowboy_Shirt, LowerWear.Ballerina_Tutu)
```

## Choosing the costumes
One more lock? This must be the last one. Get the code from the diamond lock and figure out which costume pieces it needs. Use the ``||hoc:hoc.costume()||`` function to open the lock. Set the ``||hoc:HeadWear, MidWear, and LowerWear||`` of the costumes. See the hint for all available parameters.
